# Understanding Python Function Arguments and Lambda Functions

## Overview

This project is centered around Python function arguments and lambda functions. It provides a detailed exploration of different types of arguments in Python, including keyword arguments, positional arguments, and variable-length arguments. Additionally, it covers the use of lambda functions for creating small, anonymous functions efficiently.

## Key Features

* Types of Function Arguments: Comprehensive explanations and examples of positional arguments, keyword arguments, and variable-length arguments (both *args and **kwargs).
* Lambda Functions: Detailed guide on how to use lambda functions in Python, including practical use cases.
* Building a Simple Calculator using Lambda Function: Demonstrates the implementation of a calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
* Operators in Python: Practical demonstrations of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

## Technology Used

* Python: The primary language used to demonstrate these concepts.

* Jupyter Notebook: For writing and executing Python code interactively.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone [repository-link]

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd [project-directory]

3. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or later). You can download it from the official Python website.

4. Install Jupyter Notebook using pip if you don't already have it:
   pip install notebook
    
## Run

1. Open the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the project directory.

2. Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
   jupyter notebook

3. Open the notebook file Python Function Arguments and Lambda Functions.ipynb to explore the code and execute the cells interactively.

## Conclusion

This project provides a deep dive into Python's function arguments and lambda functions, essential concepts for writing clean, efficient code. It serves as a valuable resource for beginners looking to understand these core Python features. Future enhancements could include more advanced topics on function handling and functional programming techniques.
